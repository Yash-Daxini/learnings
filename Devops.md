Localhost: It refers the computer that currently working on. Localhost is a loop back address.

Loopback address: It is a special IP address used to test network software and hardware on the local machine. It is a reserved IP address range that start from 127.0.0.0 and ends at 127.255.255.255, with 127.0.0.1 being the most commonly used loopback address, often referred to as "localhost".

Types of address: 

Need of IPV6 address: There are very limited addresses available in IPV4, so IPV6 was introduced to provide a larger address space and to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.

1. IPV4 : w.x.y.x 
          w -> 0 to 255
          x -> 0 to 255
          y -> 0 to 255
          z -> 0 to 255
2. IPV6

Mild hosting: If you host applications on intranet, where application is access by limit users thhat are available in that private network and application is not exposed in public network or on internet, then its called mild hosting. Application can be access by private network of the machine where application is hosted.

Hosts file: It is a file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is used by the operating system to resolve hostnames to IP addresses before querying DNS servers. The hosts file is typically located in the /etc/hosts directory on Unix-like systems and in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows systems. 

How to deploy apps: 

1. Renting servers on cloud 
2. Renting compute yourself in data centers
3. Self hosting (buying a CPU rack in your house)
4. Serverless providers (like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, etc.)
5. Cloud native options (k8s, ECS, etc.)

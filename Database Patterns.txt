Data Management concepts:

1.Partitioning
  It devides datasets to smaller more manageable segments. There are two fundamental approaches to   data partitioning. 
  1. Vertical partitioning: It splits tables by columns. This approach is useful when different applications or users access different columns of a table, allowing for more efficient queries and reduced data transfer.

  2. Horizontal partitioning: It splits a tables by rows. This approach is useful for distributing large datasets across multiple storage locations or servers, improving query performance and scalability.

2.Database sharding: It extends horizontal partitioning to distribute data across multiple independent database instances. Partitioning typical happens in single database while sharding uses mutlple databases often on separate physical machines. 
3.DB Indexing
4.Replication
5.Caching
6.CDN (Content Delivery Network)
7.Scalability

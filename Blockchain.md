## Blockchain

It is a digital notebook that stores information. Each page in the notebook is called a block. Each block is connected to the previous block, forming a chain. This chain of blocks is called a blockchain. Once the page(block) is full it locked and connected to previous page(block) and make a chain. This is called a blockchain. 

- Once something written in block it can't be erased or changed. This makes blockchain secure and transparent.

- Block has following information:
1. Data
2. Hash
3. Previous block's Hash

- Consensus Mechanism: It is a process to validate the transaction. It is a way to ensure that all the nodes in the network agree on the validity of the transaction. There are different types of consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.
This are the rules that decides which transaction get added to the blockchain.

 - Proof of Work: In this mechanism, miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate the transaction. Once the problem is solved, the transaction is added to the blockchain. This mechanism is used in Bitcoin. It is secure but slow. It requires significant computational power.

 - Proof of stake: In this mechanism, validators are chosen based on the number of coins they hold. The more coins they hold, the more chances they have to validate the transaction. This mechanism is faster and requires less computational power. It is used in Ethereum 2.0.
It this mechanism people stack or lock up their coins to validate the transaction.

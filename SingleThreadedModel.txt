Process: It is a simple running program.
Thread: Inside process there are threads. Which are responsible for executing tasks.

Process has its own memory space and resources.

Thread is a smaller unit inside a process that actually executes the code. Threads share memory within the same process.

In multi-threaded model, multiple threads can run concurrently within a single process. This allows for better resource utilization and improved performance, especially on multi-core processors.

But, in single threaded model only one thread can exceute at a time. This means that if one thread is blocked or waiting for a resource, the entire process is blocked.

Javascript uses single threaded model. It uses call stack and event loop to handle asynchronous operations.

Major challenge in single threaded model is in blocks the main thread.
Lake of parallelism: Mordern processors have multiple cores. So, they can run multiple threads at the same time. But in single threaded model, only one thread can run at a time. This means that the CPU is not being used to its full potential.

System reliability key concepts: 

1. CAP Theorem:
   - Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
   - Availability: Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information.
   - Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite network partitions.

2. Eventual Consistency:
   - A system is eventually consistent if, given enough time without new updates, all replicas will converge to the same state. If stop making updates to the system, all replicas will eventually become consistent with same state.
